This assignment is based on an assignment created by [German Rodriguez](http://data.princeton.edu/wws509/sets/set3.html).  Topics covered include:

- reading in tabular data
- ggplot2
- logistic regression

For this assignment you will be extending the analysis in this article:

Greene and Schaffer (1992) ["Leave to Appeal and Leave to Commence Judicial Review in Canada's Refugee-Determination System: Is the Process Fair?"](http://yorkspace.library.yorku.ca/xmlui/handle/10315/7864) International Journal of Refugee Law, 4.1: 71-83.

Here's how the authors describe the paper:
"The purpose of this study is to determine whether refugees and other persons who are applying for leave to appeal a decision of the Convention Refugee Determination Division of the Canadian Immigration and Refugee Board, a decision of the Appeal Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board, or to commence an action for judicial review have a relatively equal chance to convince the Federal Court of Appeal of the merits of their applications.""

The data and [documentation](http://socserv.mcmaster.ca/jfox/Books/Applied-Regression-2E/datasets/Greene.pdf) were made avaialble by John Fox.  I have stored a copy of the data in Greene.txt in the subfolder data.


```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(broom)


## load data
data <- read.table("data/Greene.txt") # <- could not load with readr library.
                                        #  data has irregular spacing.

## set data as dplyr table
data <- tbl_df(data)


```

Before doing anything else, just play with the data to get a sense of it.

(@) The main outcome of interest is *decision* which records whether the judge granted an appeal or not.  In what proprotion of cases did the judge grant an appeal.

```{r}
##calcualte the proportion of yes and no decisions by judge
appeals <- data %>%
  group_by(decision) %>%
  tally() %>%
  mutate(prop = n / sum(n))

appeals

#[Appeals were granted in ~ 30% of the cases]

```

(@) There are 12 different judges in the data. A key question is whether different judges have different rates of granting an appeal.  Make a plot showing the number of cases per judge.

```{r}

## claculate the number of cases per judge
judges <- data %>%
  group_by(judge) %>%
  tally() %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  mutate(judge = factor(judge, judge)) # change levels so that
                                       # plot keeps arrange by n

ggplot(judges, aes(judge, n)) +
  geom_histogram(stat = "identity") +
  ylab("Cases")




```

(@) Now plot the rate at which the judges grant appeals. 

```{r}
##calculate porpotion of appeals granted by judge
judges_prop <- data %>%
  group_by(judge, decision) %>%
  tally() %>%
  mutate(prop = n / sum(n)) %>%
  filter(decision == "yes") %>% # only keep those granted
  ungroup() %>%
  arrange(desc(prop)) %>%
  mutate(judge = factor(judge, judge)) # change levels
                                        # to keep arrange by prop of appeals
  

ggplot(judges_prop, aes(judge, prop)) + geom_histogram(stat = "identity") +
  ylab("Proportion")



```

(@) Now let's try this with logistic regression because we are going to move to more complicated models.  Fit a logistic regression predicting whetheran appeal will be granted using judge as a categorical predictor. Use Iacobucci as the reference judge to facilitate the comparisons that follow. For more on how to control the reference level of a factor, check out this post on StackOverflow: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3872070/how-to-force-r-to-use-a-specified-factor-level-as-reference-in-a-regression

```{r}

##relevel judge factor to have Iacobucci as reference
data$judge <- relevel(data$judge, ref = "Iacobucci")

##run logistic regression model
m1 <- glm(decision ~ judge, data = data, family = binomial)

tidy(m1)

```

(@) Using the results of the model calculate the predicted probability that Judge Marceau will grant an appeal.

```{r}

## create new data frame to set Marceu fixed
data_marceau <- data
## set marceu fixed
data_marceau$judge <- "Marceau"

## use predict with Marceau fixed
pp_marceau <- predict(m1, type = "response", newdata = data_marceau)

##calculate mean of predicted values to get predicted probability of observed cases
mean_marceau <- mean(pp_marceau)
mean_marceau

#[the predicted probabilty that Marceu will grant an appeal is 0.6]

```

(@) Perhaps the different judges have different types of cases.  That might be why they seem to be making such different decisions.  Fit a model treating judge as a factor plus the following predictors: (i) an indicator for whether the expert rater thought the case had merit, (ii) location indicators using 'other' as the reference category, (iii) a language dummy with French as omitted category.  Note that as above you might have to relevel the factors to get this to work as you want.

```{r}

## relevel location to have "other" as reference
data$location <- relevel(data$location, ref = "other")

##relevel language and ser French as reference
data$language <- relevel(data$language, ref = "French")

## run logistic regression model
m2 <- glm(decision ~ judge + rater + location + language,
          data = data, family = binomial)


tidy(m2)

```

(@) For a case that was ruled to have merit, that took place in Toronto, and that was in English, what is the predicted probability that Judge Marceau will grant the appeal?

```{r}

data_ytem <- data

data_ytem$rater <- "yes"
data_ytem$location <- "Toronto"
data_ytem$language <- "English"
data_ytem$judge <- "Marceau"

pp_ytem <- predict(m2, type = "response", newdata = data_ytem)

##calculate mean of predicted values to get predicted probability of observed cases
mean_ytem <- mean(pp_ytem)
mean_ytem

#[the predicted probabilty that Marceu will grant an appeal that had merit, took place in Toronto and that was in english is ~ 0.9]

```


#### The command below is helpful for debugging, please don't change it

```{r echo=FALSE}
sessionInfo()
